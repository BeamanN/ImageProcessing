# ImageProcessing
For this project, you will be completing an imageprocessing library that can process imagesusing matrix operations.  All images can be representedas a matrix of single-byte values, wherea pixel at matrix location (i, j) is represented bya number between 0 and 255.  A color imageconsists of three channels: a red channel (R),  agreen channel (G), and a blue channel (B), andthe corresponding matrix information for an imageinclude three matrixes, each with the samenumber of rows (height) and columns (width), one foreach of the three channels.  Together,these are passed to an image-writing library for outputtingto a  file and displaying.
